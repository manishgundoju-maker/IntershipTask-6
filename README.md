Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries.
Explanation of Subquery Types

Scalar subquery → returns a single value (e.g., largest order amount).

IN subquery → returns multiple values, used with IN (e.g., customers with orders).

EXISTS subquery → checks if at least one row exists (e.g., orders above 300).

Correlated subquery → refers to outer query column (e.g., matching customer_id).

FROM subquery (derived table) → treats subquery as a temporary table.
